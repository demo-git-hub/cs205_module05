i must not fear !
fear is the mind-killer
fear is the little death that comes before total obliteration
i will face my fear
i will permit it to pass over me, and through me
and when the fear has passed, i will turn the inner eye to see its path
where the fear has gone, there will be nothing
only i will remain.
